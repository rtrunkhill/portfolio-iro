title: First Technical Interview completed!
short-description: Step 1 to lucrative career: completed

__Summary__

I've conducted a ton if interviews, and been interviewed a fair number of times.  But this was the first time being quized on technical knowledge with a job on the line.

__Explanation__

Talk about scary, I've spent the last year becoming a full stack developer and now I had to show that off in front of people.  I was in that weird spot most us have been, where I know stuff, but when you're on the spot and nervous, can you demonstrate what you know?  Hah, the answer is no.  I'm calling it a beautiful disaster.  Most of the more technical questions I _knew_ but couldn't pull the answers to the front of my brain.  Some things I just couldn't put together.  I am overall very encouraged, I can pull this off.

__Problems__

I mean, just need to get my mind sorted.  I know what RESTful API's are; HTTP requests using GET, PUT, POST, and DELETE.  Of course I fumbled through that (maybe I got partial credit?).  I couldn't remember that document went before getElementByID() -> document.getElementByID();  It's just been a while since I've played around with HTML and JavaScript as I've been focusing hard on Ruby.  Some things I didn't know like what is a psuedo-class? I've used them before but I never would have remembered the name in a million years.

__Solutions__

I need to review my HTML/CSS more intensely before an interview for a front-end job.  I spent a little over a day preparing, and that was not enough.  However, now I have a much better idea of what to expect.  I am strangely emboldened by this, failure is how you learn you after all. Importantly, I felt like even with my lapses in memory, I belonged in the room.  I knew what they were talking about and could contribute.  That sounds minor, but when you're staring a new career, just that little bit of confidence can mean the world.  

__Results__

It would be a major surprise if I were selected for that job. None-the-less, I feel like it was a victory and I can't wait to dive back into my work, learn more, and prepare for the next interview!  Thank you to the guys at [Eightcig.com](https://www.eightcig.com/ ) for having me over for an interview, it's an experience I'll never forget!
