title: Challenges In Coding
---

I had no illusions that going from zero-to-developer would be easy. After all I had no practical background in software engineering beyond when I would attempt DIY IT on my own rigs.   There have been a couple _serious_ challenges due to habits I've built up outside of engineering that can make life seriously difficult.  My biggest challenge has been to SLOW DOWN.

I do everything in my life fast.  I drive fast, I talk fast, I type fast, I work fast.  With that I tend to gloss over smaller details as unimportant.  If there is a typo, well it's on the reader to figure out what I mean.  Unfortunately that just doesn't work when writing code.  Entire applications or blocks of code can be ruined because of a missing semicolon.  When I first began creating this portfolio I was missing one quotation mark (") and it ruined the ENTIRE PAGE.

Writing code is literally beating me into shape about slowing down and paying attention to the details.  At this point in my life, the philosophical change in approach is extremely difficult.  I can generally pick up the concepts and can get a good view of the overall structure or big picture.  But I have spent hours trying to fix a bug that turns out to be one small typo or missing syntax.    There is no doubt that paying attention to the details and slowing down has been my biggest challenge to date.
