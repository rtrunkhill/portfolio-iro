__Summary__

BlocJams is an audio player that is designed to be used on any computer and mobile device.  Browse your albums, select your song, and you are good to go!

__Explanation__

BlocJams is my beginner project for Front-end work.  During the building of this music player I employed and stretched my knowledge of HTML(5) and JavaScript; for the first time putting those skills to real-world use.  BlocJams was refracted twice as I learned new skills:  

* _JQuery:_   Shortening much of the lengthy JavaScript and HTML code.
* _AngularJS:_ A dynamic framework used for turning static HTML into a client-side solution based application.  It has inherent flexibility in designed and allows for two-way data binding between the model and the view.


__Problems__

Anytime you learn a new skill there are growing pains as you begin to understand what it can and cannot do.  The old axiom of _you don't know what you don't know_ has come up a lot during this journey. There were a number of times where I could look a problem and know how I want to approach it, but was not aware of the tools at my disposal.  Usually this resulted in attacking a problem a number of different ways.  I would say the biggest actual "problem" was learning how to attack actual problem-solving in writing code.


__Solutions__

I had to re-wire my brain to approach problem-solving from a different angle.  I graduated from "I'll wait to talk to my mentor or someone" to "how do I research this issue on my own."  The best advice I received during this time was from my mentor, Christine Le, who told me to get one thing working at a time.  This seemed so simple at first that I almost completely ignored it.  But later I begun to learn the WHY it is so important.  When I would get stuck, my problem would be so broad that it was nearly impossible to pin down the correct question to even ask.  By going back and getting each individual piece working one at time, you not only can identify problems quickly, but you narrow the scope of your research in how to fix them.

__Results__

While this was largely a paint-by-numbers project that turns out exactly as expected.  That being said, as I delved deeper into the project and the hand holding slowly lessens, there are definite moments of fist-pumping pride when I solved a particular task that proved troublesome.

__Conclusion__

I learned a great deal during the course building this application but my most important take away was learning _how_ to learn and attack problems.  Persistence and determination served me well throughout this project.  It laid a ground work for future software development and granted me invaluable experience.
