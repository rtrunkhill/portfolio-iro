__Summary__
BlocJams is an audio player that is designed to be used on any computer or mobile device.  Browse your albums, select your song, and you are good to go!

__Explanation__
BlocJams is my beginner project for Front-end work.  During the building of this music player I employed and stretched my knowledge of HTML(5) and JavaScript; for the first time putting those skill to real-world use.  BlocJams was refracted twice as I learned new skills:   
    * _JQuery_ shortening much of the lengthy JavaScript and HTML code.
    * _Angular_ is a dynamic framework used for turning static HTML into a client-side solution based application.  It has inherent flexibility in designed and allows for two-way data binding between the model and the view.
